AI USAGE FOR CODE: 
I used AI in a supporting role to make the workflow more efficient, while all critical decisions (feature selection, model choice, portfolio strategy) were my own. Specifically:

Helped brainstorm preprocessing approaches (e.g., handling missing/zero revenue, log transforms) and confirm they aligned with statistical best practices.

Suggested exploring keyword clusters beyond genre; I refined this into binary flags (e.g., superhero, romcom, crime) that became key predictive features.

Assisted in framing model trade-offs (Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest) so I could present both interpretability and non-linear performance.

Used to polish explanations and visualizations, ensuring insights (e.g., runtime buckets, audience engagement signals) were communicated clearly.

AI was a sparring partner, not a substitute â€” I relied on it to pressure-test my ideas, not to replace my own analysis
